CloudStor is an [AARNet](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/) service to sync, share and store files using the high-speed AARNet network. You can view the data in your CloudStor account via its easy to use, web-based [CloudStor Dashboard](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au). For information about how to set up, get started and use the CloudStor dashboard, we refer you to AARNet's [CloudStor Getting Started Guide](https://support.aarnet.edu.au/hc/en-us/articles/227469547-CloudStor-Getting-Started-Guide).
