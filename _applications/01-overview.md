Nectar have packaged some cloud-ready applications into the *Application Catalog* available from your [Nectar dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au). You can browse the catalog and compose your own application environments running on the Nectar Research Cloud.

In this tutorial you'll step through the *Quick Deploy* process for configuring and deploying an application from the catalog. Our example will be an *R-Studio* application. It gives secure access to a community edition R-Studio server, Shiny server as well as remote-desktop-based access via either your browser or X2Go.

**Keypairs** You should have a Keypair registered in your Nectar account. If you think you need help with that, you should complete our [keypair tutorial](/keypairs/) before you start here.
