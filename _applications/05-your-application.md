Once you log in with the **Username** and **Password** you provided earlier, you will reach the R-Studio landing page in this example.

You can launch R-Studio from here. We also provide a link to Shiny Server that has also been installed, and a link to access the instance desktop via browser.

R-Studio will require you to log in again with the **Username** and **Password** you provided earlier.

This application also offers access to R-Studio through *Remote Desktop* via *X2Go*. This might be especially useful for workloads that require visualisations that can't be handled from within the browser environment.

If you would like to use the Remote Desktop interface, you should install the *X2Go client*. It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux from [x2go.org](https://wiki.x2go.org/).

Once installed and running, you should click the `Create Session` button and provide the **Host**, **Login** and **SSH keypair** details. Your **Session type** should be XFCE.
