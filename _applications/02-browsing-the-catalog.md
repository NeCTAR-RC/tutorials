In this tutorial we will browse the Application Catalog and use *Quick Deploy* to configure your own instance of R-Studio running on Nectar. 

1. Log on to on your [Nectar Dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au) and ensure you're working in the right project (use the project selector on the top left-hand side).
2. Navigate to the `Applications | Browse | Browse Local` page 
3. If you don't immediately see the application you need, just type it into the search field on the right. For this tutorial, let's find `R-Studio`
4. Once you've found it, click `Quick Deploy`.
