### What is Launching

In Nectar you can create your own Virtual Machines, using the [dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au). We call it *Launching*.

In this tutorial you'll step through the *Launch dialog* to configure and launch a Virtual Machine (also known as Instance).

**Cloud Starter**
This tutorial is part of the Nectar Cloud Starter curriculum. You should be familiar with the absolute basics of Security Groups, you should have a Keypair and you should have terminal software installed on your machine. If you think you need help with any of that, you should complete those tutorials first.
