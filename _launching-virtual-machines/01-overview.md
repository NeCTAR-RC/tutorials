### What is Launching

In Nectar you can create your own Virtual Machines. We call it *Launching*.  From your [Nectar dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au) it is easy to start the launch dialog, and from there it is straightforward to create a basic Virtual Machine. 

In this tutorial you'll step through the *Launch dialog* to configure and launch a Virtual Machine. And just in case you're wondering: yes, we use the word _Instance_ a lot. In Nectar it is synonymous with *Virtual Machine*.

**Cloud Starter**  
This tutorial is part of the Nectar Cloud Starter curriculum. You should be familiar with the absolute basics of Security Groups, you should have a Keypair and you should have terminal software installed on your machine. If you think you need help with any of that, you should complete Cloud Starter tutorials before you start here.
