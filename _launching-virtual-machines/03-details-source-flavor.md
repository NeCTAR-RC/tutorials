### Details

Your instance must have a **name**; a **description** is optional. In certain circumstances you deliberately choose the **Availability Zone**, but you can also let Nectar decide by choosing *Any Availability Zone*. You can launch multiple instances at a time by setting the **Count**

### Source

Let's choose a **Boot Source**, for this tutorial, we are are going to select `NeCTAR Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) amd64`.

Use the Filter widget to help you find the image you need; Use the up-arrow button beside the image you need to select it for launch

If you started the Launch dialog from the *Images* page, instead of the *Instances* page, the Source tab is already configured right. If you need to, you can make changes.

### Filters

A quick word on Filters: Throughout the Nectar Dashboard youâ€™ll find filters to help you find images, flavors, security groups, networks etc. You can type free text into filters, or build specific filters as shown in the example here

### Flavor

Use the Filter widget to help you find the Flavor you need.

For this tutorial, we are going to select `t3.small`.

Use the up-arrow button beside the flavor you need to select it for launch
