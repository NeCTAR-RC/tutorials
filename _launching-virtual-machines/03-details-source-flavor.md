### Details

Your instance must have a **name**; a **description** is optional. In certain circumstances you deliberately choose the **Availability Zone**, but you can also let Nectar decide by choosing *Any Availability Zone*. You can launch multiple instances at a time by setting the **Count**

### Source

Choose a **Boot Source** (most common is *Image*)

Use the Filter widget to help you find the image you need; Use the up-arrow button beside the image you need to select it for launch

If you started the Launch dialog from the *Images* page, instead of the *Instances* page, the Source tab is already configured right. If you need to, you can make changes.

### Filters

A quick word on Filters: Throughout the Nectar Dashboard you’ll find filters to help you find images, flavors, security groups, networks etc. You can type free text into filters, or build specific filters as shown in the example here

### Flavor

Use the Filter widget to help you find the Flavor you need

Use the up-arrow button beside the flavor you need to select it for launch
