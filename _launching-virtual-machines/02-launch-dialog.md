In this tutorial we will use the *Launch Dialog* and configure the most basic Virtual Machine possible.

1. Logon to your [Nectar Dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au) and ensure you're working in the right project (Use the project selector on the top left-hand side)
2. Navigate to the `Project` / `Compute` / `Instances` page
3. Click the `Launch Instance` button to start the Launch Dialog
