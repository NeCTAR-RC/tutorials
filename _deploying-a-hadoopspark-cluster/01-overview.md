In this tutorial, you will be able to deploy a Hadoop/Spark Cluster on their Nectar Cloud instance. This can enable you to conduct faster large scale data processing/analysis.

Elasticluster will be used to deploy Hadoop/Spark. ElastiCluster is an open-source tool to create and manage compute clusters on cloud infrastructures. The project was originally created by the [Grid Computing Competence Center](https://www.gc3.uzh.ch/) from the University of Zurich. However, the Nectar cloud team maintains our own [Elasticluster](https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/elasticluster) which was forked from the official source code to meet our requirements.

### What you'll learn
- How to install Python Development tools, virtual environment and elasticluster on their cloud instance
- How to configure Elasticluster
- How to use elasticluster to deploy Hadoop/Spark
- How to  list information about the cluster, grow the cluster and terminate the cluster.


### What you'll need

- A running Nectar Instance
- Terminal Software
