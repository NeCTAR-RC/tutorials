title: Allow connections by Security Groups
order: 4
duration: 5

If you chose `Security Group` for the `Remote` option, you can choose an existing security group as the source for the new rule.

Instead of opening network traffic to a range of IP addresses, access can be granted to virtual machine instances that have a chosen security group assigned to them. This is particularly useful where you may have a group of instances and you may want to allow access between them all.
