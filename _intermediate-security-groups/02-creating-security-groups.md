by choosing `Security Groups` from the navigation menu, under `Project` -> `Network`

You will be guided to provide a name for your new `Security Group` and an
optional description.

## Managing Security Group rules
Click `Manage Rules` button from the actions list for the security group you wish to manage.
From this page, you can add or delete rules using the buttons provided.

There are a number of fields presented that are significant here. Depending on
your choices, the required fields will change.

### Rule
You can choose either a common pre-defined service (like HTTP, SSH, etc) or
a custom option, depending on your requirements. Custom TCP and UDP rules
will require port numbers for their rules, but other protocols do not.

### Direction
You can choose from either `Ingress` or `Egress`. You will most likely want to
choose ingress here to filter incoming traffic. By default, all egress traffic
is allowed.

### Open Port
You can choose one of the following options;
 - **Port**: For a single port.
 - **Port Range**: For a range of ports.
 - **All ports**: All ports for a given protocol.

### Port
The port number you wish to allow acces for. If you chose a port range, you
would be required to provide a `From Port` and a `To Port` instead.

### Remote
You have the option of `CIDR` or `Security Group` here. These options are
explained in detail in the next pages.
