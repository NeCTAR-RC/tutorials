### What is Swift client

The Swift client is a Python client to access Swift (Object Storage) API. It has two components: a Python API (the swiftclient module) for accessing Swift programmatically and a command-line script (swift).

You can find more information from the [Python Swift client website](https://opendev.org/openstack/python-swiftclient).

### Installation

We assume you use Ubuntu 19.04 and python3 to install the Swift Python client.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-swiftclient
```

### Set up Login Credentials

Before you can start, you need to setup the login details.

You can do this through our [CLI tutorial here]({{ site.baseurl }}/openstack-cli/04-credentials).
### Command Line Interface (CLI)

After you have sourced your authentication file, you can type the below command to get all available options for the swift command:

```
swift --help
```

The below lists all containers in your project:

```
swift list
```

To find more information about how to use the Swift CLI, please see the [python-swiftclient CLI website](https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/latest/cli/index.html).

### Python Code
Besides using the CLI, you can also write Python code to access containers. In this section we present some simple code examples that demonstrate the usage of the python-swiftclient API. You can find full details of the options and methods available to the API at the [python-swiftclient project website](https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/latest/introduction.html).

List the available containers:

```python
import swiftclient

user = username
key = password
auth_url = 'https://identity.rc.nectar.org.au/v3/'
auth_version = '3'
os_options = {
    'user_domain_name':'Default',
    'project_domain_id':'default',
    'project_name': project_name
}

conn = swiftclient.Connection(user=user,key=key,os_options=os_options, auth_version=auth_version,authurl=auth_url)

containers = conn.get_account()

for container in containers:
    print(container)
```

Create a new container:
```python
container = 'new-container'
conn.put_container(container)
containers = conn.get_account()
if container in containers:
    print(container)
```
