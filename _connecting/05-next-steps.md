In this tutorial you learnt how to connect to your instance using `ssh`. Using the `ssh` connection you created a password for the default user account, which in turn allowed you to use an alternative connection method: the `vnc`-console on the Nectar dashboard.

To build on your Nectar Research Cloud remote computing skills you can now learn to operate from the command line, install and maintain software on your instance, and transfer data to and from your instance.
