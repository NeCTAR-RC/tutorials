One of the most basic ways of driving a computer, whether virtual or physical, whether remote or local, is using the command line. The command line of remote computers, which includes our Nectar virtual machines, can be accessed using a Secure SHell (or ssh) connection. It is called "Secure" because `ssh` encrypts all its communications, and it's called a `shell`, because... well it appears that nobody really knows why it's called a *shell* <sup>###</sup>. Nevermind.  

We can also access our instance using a webpage in the Nectar dashboard through a web-based `vnc`-console. The `vnc`-console gives us access to our instance command line, without the need for separate terminal software.

In this tutorial you will learn how to connect to our instance using [terminal software](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000223964-terminal-software) and `ssh`. We'll set up a user account password to enable access to our `vnc`-console, and then connect using the `vnc`-console. 

**Cloud Starter**
This tutorial is part of the Nectar Cloud Starter curriculum. Only the bare essentials of `ssh`-connecting are explained here. The `vnc`-console is optional in the cloud starter curriculum, but it can be useful in the unlikely event of troubleshooting your instance.
