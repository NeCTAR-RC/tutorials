One of the most basic ways of driving a computer, whether virtual or physical is using the command line. The command line of remote computers (including Nectar virtual machines), can be accessed using a Secure Shell (or ssh) connection.

We can also access our instance using a webpage in the Nectar dashboard through a web-based `vnc`-console. The `vnc`-console gives us access to our instance command line, without the need for separate terminal software.

In this tutorial you will learn how to connect to your instance using [terminal software](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000223964-terminal-software) and SSH. We'll set up a user account password to enable access to our `vnc`-console, and then connect using the `vnc`-console.

**Cloud Starter**  
This tutorial is part of the Nectar Cloud Starter curriculum. Only the bare essentials of SSH-connecting are explained here. The `vnc`-console is optional in the cloud starter curriculum, but it can be useful in the unlikely event of troubleshooting your instance.
