Headless computer is a computer that is operated without the traditional monitor, keyboard and mouse peripherals. Virtual Machine running in Nectar Cloud is an example of headless computer. Headless computing is to use headless computers to run computing tasks.

The benefits of headless computing:

- Low cost. It is cheaper to launch a headless computer (virtual machine) than a traditional computer
- Longer running time. Headless computer in Nectar Research Cloud 
can run 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. It means you an run a task which requires very long running time

In this tutorial, we are going to introduce to use Virtual Machine to run computing tasks which takes very long time to complete. 

**Cloud Two**
This tutorial is part of the Nectar Cloud Two curriculum. You should be familiar with the Nectar Cloud Starter and Cloud One curriculum. If you think you need help with any of that, you should complete Cloud Starter and Cloud One tutorials before you start here.
