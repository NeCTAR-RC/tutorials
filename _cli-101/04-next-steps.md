In this tutorial you learnt some basic navigation and manipulation of the filesystem on your instance via the command line. You also learnt how to upgrade existing software and install new software and you learnt that *sudo* will elevate your *sudo*-privileged accounts to do such administrator tasks.

You can learn much more about the shell, bash or the command line from the web, but with the skills learnt here, you'll be all set to complete our Nectar tutorials.
