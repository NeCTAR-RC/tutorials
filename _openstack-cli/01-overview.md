### What is Nectar Cloud OpenStack CLI?

The Nectar Cloud OpenStack command line interface(CLI) is a unified command-line client for Nectar Cloud that brings the command set for Compute, Image, Object Storage and other functions together in a single shell with an uniform command structure. 

You can use the CLI to manage your Nectar project just like what you can do on the Dashboard. The good thing to use CLI is that you can run the commands from the command line or include the commands within scripts to automate tasks. If you provide credentials, such as user name and password, you can run these commands on any computer. You can use the unified `openstack` command (python-openstackclient) for the most of services. For more information, see [OpenStack Client](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/).

OpenStack project provides a common-line client for each service such as the Compute server provides a nova command-line client. You can use individual client for each service if you prefer. You can get a list of available clients from this [website](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-overview.html). 

 If you want to get more information please visit the [OpenStack CLI Webiste](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-overview.html).
