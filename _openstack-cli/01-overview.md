## What are the OpenStack CLIs?

The OpenStack command line interfaces (CLI) are command-line clients for interacting with the Nectar Research Cloud.

You can use the CLIs to manage your Nectar project resources just like you would through the Dashboard.
The benefits of using CLI are that you can run the commands from the command line and include the commands within scripts to automate tasks.

The Nectar Research Cloud services can be used by either the unified OpenStackClient tool (`openstack`) or a dedicated client for a service.
In many cases, you can use both the OpenStack client or a dedicated client.

If you want to get more information please visit the latest [OpenStack CLI documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/)
or you can search for documentation about each of the dedicated clients.
