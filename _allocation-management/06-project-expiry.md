order: 6
duration: 2

Project allocations on the Nectar Research Cloud are created for a fixed term to help ensure fair access to resources for all users of the cloud. When a project allocation nears the end, project managers and members are notified via email.

The expiry process is an automated process that follows the rules that are set out in our article on [Expiry and Renewal](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000171494-project-allocation-expiry-and-renewal).

**Warning**
Familiarize yourself with the expiry rules: the *Timeline*, *Action by Nectar* and the *Options for Users*. The last step of expiry -after a generous grace period- is that Nectar deletes the project's resources. Yes. *Deletes.* You can find our [Expiry and Renewal](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000171494-project-allocation-expiry-and-renewal) article here.
