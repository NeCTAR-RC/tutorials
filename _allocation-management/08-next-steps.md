In this tutorial you've learnt about Allocation Management. You've learnt what sets *pt-projects* apart from *projects*. You've learnt how to avoid *data-loss-by-expiry* by Amending/Extending your project and you've learnt how to share/delegate your project-manager role with other members of your project. 

All we hope for in return is that you remember us fondly, when you're attending any [banquets in Sweden](https://www.nobelprize.org/ceremonies/the-nobel-prize-award-ceremonies-and-banquets/).
