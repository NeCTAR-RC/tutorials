### What is Git

Git is a free and widely used open source version control system. It is a distributed version control system. Unlike CVS or Subversion, in Git, everyone has the full history of their code repository locally rather than a single place for the full version history.

 
### Why do you need Git

1. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been changed, and you can revert to specific versions if you need to.
2. Git makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
