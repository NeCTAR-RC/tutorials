You can use the Nectar DNS Service to add Domain Name System (DNS) services to
your Nectar Research Cloud projects. The Nectar DNS Service is based on the
OpenStack DNS as a Service project, *Designate*.

For new projects and projects with allocations being renewed, a *Nectar provided*
*DNS zone* will be created automatically for your project to use. The zone name
will be based on your given project name, typically *[yourproject].cloud.edu.au*, and 
will be available for you to create records in right away.

The Nectar DNS service can also host a domain name you currently own. If you
would like *Bring Your Own Zone* to the Nectar DNS service, please send an email
request to [support@nectar.org.au](mailto:support@nectar.org.au) and we will create the zone for you.

Once you have a zone created for your project, you are free to create and
delete any records you wish within this zone.
