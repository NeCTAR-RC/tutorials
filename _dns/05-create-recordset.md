You can use the Nectar dashboard to create a new DNS record for an instance in
your project. Navigate to **Project -> DNS -> Zones**, then select **Create
Record Set**. The Create Record Set form will open so you can configure the new
record set.

![Create Record Set]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dns-with-designate/dns-create-rs.png)

Complete the following fields then click **Submit**:
- **Type** is *A - Address record* for a new DNS name.
- **Name** is your new DNS name. The DNS name must end with the DNS zone name,
  including the last '.'.
- **Records** is a list of the instance IP addresses. You typically only need
  to add one record using the primary IP address of the instance (from
  **Project -> Compute -> Instances** on the dashboard).

To create a DNS record for your instance using the OpenStack command line:

```
$ openstack recordset create <zone name> <hostname you choose> --type A --record <ip addr>

```

For example:

```
$ openstack recordset create qcif-test.cloud.edu.au. my-name --type A --record 203.101.225.247
```

Check that the record was created correctly using:

```
$ openstack recordset list qcif-test.cloud.edu.au.
+------+---------------------------------+------+-----------------+--------+--------+
| id   | name                            | type | records         | status | action |
+------+---------------------------------+------+-----------------+--------+--------+
| ...  |                                 |      |                 |        |        |
| <id> | my-name.qcif-test.cloud.edu.au. | A    | 203.101.225.247 | ACTIVE | NONE   |
| ...  |                                 |      |                 |        |        |
+------+---------------------------------+------+-----------------+--------+--------+
```

To check that the DNS name is working, you can try accessing the instance with
SSH. For an Ubuntu Nectar instance try:

```
ssh -i <keyfile> ubuntu@<instance-name>.<project-name>.cloud.edu.au
```
