Virtual Machines in the Nectar Research Cloud are very flexible. You have control over the size and number of instances you launch in your project. Occasionally you'll have reason to *reboot* your instance. If you didn't really get your instance quite right on your first try, you can *rebuild* it with a different image, or a *resize* it to a different flavour. When you're done with an instance you can just *delete* it.

### What you'll learn

- Life-cycle events of your instance: *Rebooting*, *Resizing*, *Rebuilding*, *Deleting*.
- Use the Instance Action Menu Button

### What you'll need

- Some spare capacity in your Nectar Research Cloud account for launching a trial instance and/or resizing an instance.

**Setting up**  
As we will be quite destructive in the sections *Rebuilding* and *Deleting* below, we strongly recommend that you launch a new instance specifically for the purpose of this tutorial.
