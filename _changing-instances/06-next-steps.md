In this tutorial you learnt how to resize, rebuild, reboot and delete your instances using the Instance Action Menu on the Nectar Dashboard. These are four life cycle events of virtual machines help make cloud computing very flexible. You can experiment with configuration of your instances and throw them away completely guilt-free. Not to mention *free*. Full Stop.

In this tutorial we've mentioned *managing your data* a few times. If you haven't already done so, you should learn ways of doing this in our tutorials [*Volume Storage*](/volume-storage/) (Nectar's virtual USB drives) and [*Moving Data*](/moving-data/).
