For X11 forwarding in SSH to work on your computer, an X server must be installed and running. The X server is a software package that manages the connection between the remote graphical application and your computer. It receives the input from your computer and renders the graphical interface.

Most Linux systems will have an X server installed, so you really don't need to do anything. However, if your computer is running Windows or macOS, you will need to install and run an X server application.

### Installation of X server on Windows
