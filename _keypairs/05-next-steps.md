 In this tutorial you've obtained a key pair and registered it in your Nectar account. You are one step away from being able to launch your own virtual machines.

If you haven't already done so, you should learn [**the basics of security groups**]({{sitebase.url}}/sec-groups-101/01-overview) and then learn to [**Launch Virtual Machines**]({{sitebase.url}}/launching-virtual-machines/01-overview) from the Nectar Dashboard.

**Cloud Starter**<br/>
