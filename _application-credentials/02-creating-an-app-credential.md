1. Provide a credential name in the `Name` field.
1. You can leave the `Secret` field blank, and a secure secret will be generated for you.
1. Optionally, provide an expiration date in the `Expiration Date` field.
1. Optionally, select the roles to grant to this application credential.
   Selecting nothing will grant all roles listed. If you have more than one
   role, it's best to limit what you grant here to just what your script
   requires. Usually the `Member` role is enough.
1. Click the `Create Application Credential` button.
1. Click the `Download openrc file` button and the `Download clouds.yaml` button.
