A common requirement when setting up a Nectar project is to handle scripted
tasks such as automated instance launching, snapshots and backups. To make these
scripts functional you will need valid credentials in order to talk to the
relevant OpenStack APIs. One way to do this is to use your personal Nectar
credentials. However, there are security and other concerns with embedding
personal credentials into scripts, especially when you want to share your
scripts with others.

`Application Credentials` are designed to solve the above problem. Users can use
this facility to create their own OpenStack credentials for authorising scripted
tasks that access specific services. These credentials may be created for
specific tasks and/or services and may be revoked individually by the user who
created them. They can also be created to expire after a period and will be
automatically invalidated if the user's access is removed. This makes them
relatively safe to embed into scripts.

This tutorial is part of the Nectar **Cloud Two** curriculum. You should be
familiar with the Nectar Cloud Starter and Cloud One curriculum. If you think
you need help with any of that, you should complete Cloud Starter and Cloud One
tutorials before you start here.
