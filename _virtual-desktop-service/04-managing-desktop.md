title: Managing your Virtual Desktop
order: 4

Once you have created one Desktop, you will see four options on your screen to manage it.

![image of computer options]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/virtual-desktop-service/button_option.PNG)

Here are what each of these options means:

| Button      | What it does |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Reboot      |Restart your Virtual Desktop.|
| Shelve   |This put your Virtual Desktop on "on the shelf".  It is equivalent to turning off a computer, and it frees up some of the resources that the Desktop uses. If not taken off the shelf, the desktop will be deleted a month after it has been shelved. To turn it back on, you can simply click the **unshelve** button to turn it back on.|
| Extend   |When you are close to expiry, you can extend your Virtual Desktop for a further 14 days of use (starting now). You can extend a Virtual Desktop indefinitely (but see "Desktop End of Life" below). |
| Delete   |This deletes your Virtual Desktop.|
| Boost   |While using the Virtual Desktop, if you feel you need more compute power or memory, you can boost to 16 Virtual CPU Cores and 32 GB RAM.|

These are simple: all you need to do is click the particular button to make it happen.  You need to remember to save your work to the Virtual Desktop's disk before you perform a Reboot, Shelve or Boost.

**The power of delete**  üóëÔ∏è  
When you click the delete button, be *absolutely sure* you want to delete your desktop!! Once it is gone, we cannot recover the desktop or its data. There are no recycle bins here.

**Keep an eye on the time**  ‚è∞  
Once you have launched a Virtual Desktop, this desktop will be available for *14 days*. After 14 days, the desktop will initiate an expiry process, with the instance shelved for 1 month, and then *deleted*. You will receive email reminders at each stage of the expiry process. However, remember, you are able to extend your desktop for another 14 days, using the extend button as well.

**Keeping up to date**  
Our Virtual Desktop images are configured to automatically apply security patches supplied the base operating system vendor.  Non-security updates are not applied automatically, but you are free to apply them yourself.  (Refer to the "Command Line" tutorial.)

**Desktop End of Life**  
All operating systems eventually reach an "end of life" when the vendor stops providing security updates.  When a Virtual Desktop's base operating system reaches end of life, we will deem the Desktop to be end of life also.  When that happens, you will need to delete your Desktop and create a new one.

**You can manage it all now!**  
Well done. You know how to manage your desktop and what the different buttons mean. On [the next page we wrap up]({{ site.baseurl }}/virtual-desktop-service/05-next-steps), and provide some final important links.
