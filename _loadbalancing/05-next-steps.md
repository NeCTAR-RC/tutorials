In this tutorial we have explored the concepts of load balancing and how you
can use them in a pratical way on the Nectar Research Cloud.

### Orchestration
This tutorial walked through the process of setting up some advanced networking
resources to demonstrate how the load balancing service works.

In practise, creating so many resources in a manual way can error prone and
tedious, so we recommend that you build your resources in a programmatic way,
such as with the Nectar Orchestration Service.

If you haven't yet completed the
[Orchestration Service]({{ site.baseurl }}/orchestration)
tutorial, we highly recommend it, along with the
[example templates](https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates) for it.
