### What is a snapshot?

A snapshot is a way of making a copy of the disk state of an Nectar instance or a volume so the state can be preserved at a particular time.
It is easy to create a snapshot of the root disk of a instance or volume by using the snapshot dialog in the [Nectar dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au). 
 
In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to take snapshots of instances and volumes, and then go through the process of restoring from a snapshot.
