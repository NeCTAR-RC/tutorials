Security Groups are Nectar's way of specifying what network traffic can reach into -and out of- your Virtual Machine (VM). By default a VM brought up in the Nectar Research Cloud can reach out to the world via the network, but the world canâ€™t reach in.

You need to specify any network traffic to be allowed to reach the VM via the Rules in a Security Group.

Security groups can be applied to VMs at launch and can be applied or removed at any other time in the VMs life.

**Cloud Starter**<br/>This tutorial is part of the Nectar Cloud Starter curriculum. Only the *bare essentials* of security groups are discussed here. For more in depth review see the Nectar [Security Group documentation](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055387).
