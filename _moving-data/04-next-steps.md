In this tutorial you learnt the very basics of copying data between your (local) machine and your (remote) instance using `scp` from the command line or using a graphical tool like Cyberduck.

There are many tools that do a similar job (e.g. on the command line `rsync`, `rcp`, and graphically FileZilla or WinSCP). There are also many tools that tackle data transfer use cases quite differently (think for instance CloudStor, DropBox or OneDrive). Many applications will allow data transfer via their own application specific user interfaces (RStudio server, Jupyter notebooks, Guacamole remote desktops)
