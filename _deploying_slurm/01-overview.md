Through completing this tutorial, learners will deploy a slurm cluster on the NeCTAR cloud using ElastiCluster.

ElastiCluster is an open-source tool to create and manage compute clusters on cloud infrastructures.
The project was originally created by the [Grid Computing Competence Center](https://www.gc3.uzh.ch/) from the University of Zurich. The Nectar cloud team maintains our own [ElastiCluster](https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/elasticluster) which was forked from the official source code to meet our requirements.

Slurm is used for even compute resource distribution between users. As a user, you can submit jobs with specific resources requests through Slurm.

- How to configure ElastiCluster accordingly
- How to use ElastiCluster to deploy a slurm cluster.
- How to list information about the cluster, grow the cluster and terminate the cluster.


### What you'll need

- A running Nectar instance
- Terminal Software
