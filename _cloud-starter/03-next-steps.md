In this Tutorial Series you have learnt the basics of cloud computing in the Nectar Research Cloud. We hope you have enjoyed learning and have the skills  and confidence to run a basic Virtual Machine in the cloud, install the software that you need and do your research.

From here you can make things *easier* (check out our tutorial on Applications for instance), or *better* (e.g. add Volume Storage and Move your data around) or much *more sophisticated* (e.g. implementing Advanced Networking).
