There are some key words you should know, which will help make your learning experience in our Cloud Basics tutorial much easier.

**Virtual Machine/Instance:** a term used to describe your cloud computer.

**Availability Zone:** this is the physical data centre location where an instance resides.

**Flavor:** a flavor prescribes the size of a collection of virtual machine components, such as memory and CPU. You can't select the size of these components individually, but select a flavour type (example: small, medium, large) which predefines the size of each component appropriately.

**Image:** a file that contains an operating system, which is added to a blank instance.

**SSH:** This is short for Secure Shell. It is a way to setup an encrypted (secure) connection between your computer and the cloud computer, usually via the command line.
