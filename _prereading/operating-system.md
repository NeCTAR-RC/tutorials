Just like your standard computer, your Cloud computer has an Operating System, this being Linux, with a number of distributions (a.k.a versions) available: Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE and CentOS.

The Operating Systems are contained within Images,of which there are a number available for use. Find out more information [via our Image catalogue here](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000106269-image-catalog).

Note: Windows is not available within our official catalogue, however you may be able to access via your your institution. [Learn more here](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000245786-summary-of-support-for-windows-instances-by-nectar-cloud-nodes).

#### Why are we highlighting this?

This is important to understand, so you **know how to find instructions and/or troubleshoot problems you have**. For example, you may wish to install a particular package or software on your Cloud Computer. To do this you would search 'How to install [insert package name] on Linux', which should (hopefully!) lead to the instructions you need.
