The Operating Systems are contained within Images,of which there are a number available for use. Find out more information [via our Image catalogue here](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000106269-image-catalog).

#### Why are we highlighting this?

This is important to understand, so you **know how to find instructions and/or troubleshoot problems you have**. For example, you may wish to install a particular package or software on your Cloud Computer. To do this you would search 'How to install [insert package name] on Linux', which should (hopefully!) lead to the instructions you need.
