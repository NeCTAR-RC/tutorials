There are two aspects to accessing the Nectar Cloud, the Administrative aspect, and the Technical aspect.

**Administrative Checklist**
- *Having an AAF email*

This is your university/institutional email.

- *Access your trial project*

Everyone with an AAF email address receives a free project trial. When you log in to the dashboard for the first time, this activates it. More information about the length and size of your trial resources, can be found [here.](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000068044-managing-an-allocation)

- *Fill out an Allocation Request form*

If you decide to use the Nectar Cloud for your research, you would then fill in an allocation request form, and your request would be assessed. Read More information about submitting a request [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/allocation-management/04-allocation-and-projects).

**Technical aspect**

There are some new things you'll need to learn:

- New Terminology
- Using the Command Line
- Security principles and tools
- Navigating the Nectar Dashboard and Software for file transfer.
